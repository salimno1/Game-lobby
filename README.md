# Project Title

My First React Project

## Project Description

This is my first React project that I created as part of a school assignment. The main focus of the project was on CSS design and state management. The project consists of a simple user interface where users can input their name and select a color, and the application will display a greeting message in the selected color.

## Installation

To install and run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project directory in your preferred code editor.
3. In the terminal, run the command `npm install` to install the project dependencies.
4. Once the dependencies are installed, run the command `npm start` to start the development server.
5. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## Usage

To use the application, follow these steps:

1. Enter your name in the input field.
2. Select a color from the dropdown menu.
3. Click the "Submit" button.
4. The application will display a greeting message in the selected color.


## State Management

In this project, I used the React Hooks library for state management. Specifically, I used the `useState` hook to manage the user's name and selected color. Whenever the user inputs a new value, the state is updated and the UI is re-rendered to reflect the changes.

## CSS Design

For CSS design I also added some custom CSS to adjust the styles to my liking. The application has a simple, clean design with a focus on readability and user experience.
